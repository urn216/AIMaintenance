P{Your model is performing significantly worse than Wellington Penetentiary is comfortable with. Your choice of K-Nearest-Neighbour may be limiting the performance of your model.

What would you like to do?}

C{
  N{Change underlying model}
  O{You decide that K-Nearest-Neighbour models are unsuited for complicated tasks such as these, and that a change of model is necessary. You decide to rebuild from scratch, wasting months of work.}

  R{generic_at_risk}
}

C{
  N{Simplify feature set}
  O{With a smaller feature-set, you know that K-Nearest-Neighbour models perform better as there is less potential interference from other dimensions with less correlation to the outcome.

Unfortunately, parole decisions require many considerations and removing features hurts performance as much as it helps the knn model. You are unable to improve the performance in this way.}

C{
  N{Train new data}
  O{You decide to include the past output data from your model as new training data in your knn model. 

The performance worsens as the new training data is wildly inaccurate. This reinforces the bad classifications the model was making already.}
