                      ////////////////////        ////////////////////

This is a text-based game I developed to cover a wide array of potential ethical considerations in the use of AI in critical roles throughout society.

Bundled with it is a reference sheet with references cited by various prompts within the game itself. If you see a [#] within the text in the game, this reference sheet will have a corresponding source for it, explaining where inspiration for the topic came from.

The only story present within the game at current is that of an AI deployed within a fictional prison. This one story covers a great many ethical questions and has many branching paths - a replay or two couldn't hurt. In the future I may even add more stories to this game. The engine I built from the ground up is very easy to use (if I say so myself), and I thoroughly enjoyed making the current story as is.

For the presentation aspect of this assignment I'll be happy to answer questions about the game as well as giving a live demo with commentary as I see fit - describing the thought-processes behind the various dilemmae as presented.

If you would like to see the inner-workings of the code, look in the src folder - warning: I didn't comment much, and there's a loooot that went into it: including a fully custom user interface.

If you would like to read through all the prompts and various choices you can make, you can search in the data/prompts/ directory. 

A prompt consists of; the prompt itself - labeled P; any choices - labeled C (containing N - the name of the option, O the outcome text of pressing the button, Q and R as discussed for prompts in a sec); any queued prompts, to be played immediately after the current prompt - labeled Q; and lastly any random prompts, to be played in any order sometime after the current prompt.

MAKE SURE TO UNZIP AIMAINTENANCE BEFORE USE!!!

In order to run the project, one must either run the shell script provided if on linux, the .bat file if on windows, or failing that, copy the lines one-by-one from either into a terminal opened in the AIMaintenance directory. This should compile the code, generate a .jar file, and run the .jar. if all else fails, please don't hesitate to email me at kiltywill@myvuw.ac.nz

I hope you enjoy playing it through as much as I enjoyed making it!
